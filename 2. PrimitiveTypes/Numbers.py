# ** is used for exponent i.e. first number raised to the power second number
print(10 // 3)
# // is used to get an integer part from the evaluation

# % is used to give remainder when the 2 operators are divided
x += 3
# is same as x = x + 3, it is called augmented operator.... it can be used with
# any of the above operators like x -=3 or x *= 3 and so on
